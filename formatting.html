	HMTL formatting

	You can format text without CSS
	Of course, CSS would be still better

	Physical tag = provide visual appearance to text
	Logical tag = used to add some logical or sematic value to the text

	SEMATIC values
	/* Why is it important that our HTML is semantic?

	Well, for example, when it comes to finding a page on the internet,
	search engines ‘see’ the page without styles and the only way to understand
	which elements are more important is through marking. That is, if we put the
	name of the page inside a ‘<p>’ (paragraph) tag, it is likely to be lost in
	other content and not show up in the search engine results. But if we
	place it inside a ‘<h1>’ (header 1) tag, the search engines know that
	they have to give it more importance. Therefore, search engine optimization
	is a very good reason to use semantic markup. */

	Examples of HTML formatting Tags

	<b> bold - physical
	<strong> this is important - logical (so bold but something idk)
	<i> italic - physical
	<em> logical tag , displays content in italic
	<mark> physical - highlight text
	<u> underline - physical
	<tt> used to make text appear in teletype (not supported in HTML5)
	<strike> used to draw a strikethrough on a section of text (not suppoerted in HTMLS)
	<sup> superscript
	<sub> subscript
	<del> display content which is deleted.. so like.. gone.. yeah
	<ins> display content which is added
	<big> increase the font size by 1
	<small> decrease the font size by 1
